# Top-Stock-Finder
Find the best stocks from NASDAQ

This repository includes two python files and a csv file, Stocks.py gets the NASDAQ stocks and uses linear regression to see how fast each stock is growing. Stock_Predictor.py takes in the ticker and how many days you want to see into the line, and returns the predicted value and plots the line and stock price. Stock_Rate_Changes.csv's first column is the tickers, and the second column is the rate of change.
